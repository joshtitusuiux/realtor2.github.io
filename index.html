							<H2>Agile</H2>
							<p>We began by conducting stakeholder interviews and then gathered the functional requirements we would need for the website design. We met every week.  </p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<P>
								I led a study over the course of 3 days to analyze the performance of the real estate website we had completed. I recruited five participants and asked them to “speak aloud” as they completed 3 simple tasks on the website through remote and in-person testing. I questioned them about their thought process in each session, and took notes while they completed the 3 tasks on the website. 

						<h3> The Tasks </h3>
						Participants were asked to share their general likes and dislikes about the website and "speak aloud" as they completed 3 tasks on the website.
						<br>
						1. Task 1 was to explore the website and find a page that listed houses.  
						<br>
						2. Task 2 was to use the search filter to specifically find housees with 3 bedrooms. 
						<br>
						3. Task 3 was to book a consultation session with the real estate agent.  
						<br>
						</P>

						<h3>The Findings</h3>
							<p>The study revealed that the website was easy to use and intuitive for most participants, but that there were still small areas for improvement. 

						<h3>In Conclusion</h3>	
					</p>The website met the client's needs and gave him an optimized way of reaching current and potential customers through his real estate business and he was happy with the final website design.
